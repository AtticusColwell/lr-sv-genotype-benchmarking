# Long-read Structural Variant Genotyping Analysis

Short exploratory project analyzing structural variant detection accuracy using long-read sequencing data.

## Reference
Based on: Jiang, T., Cao, S., Liu, Y. et al. (2025). "Long-read sequencing technologies have great potential for the comprehensive discovery of structural variations (SVs). However, accurate genotype assignment for SVs remains challenging." *Genome Biology* 26:166. Published June 16, 2025.

## Usage
Run R scripts in order: `data_gen.R` → `analysis.R` → `vis.R` → `report.R`

## Output
Generates accuracy metrics and visualizations for SV detection across coverage depths and read lengths, focusing on genotype assignment challenges identified in recent long-read sequencing research.
